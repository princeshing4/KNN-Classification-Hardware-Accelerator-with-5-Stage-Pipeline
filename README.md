üèóÔ∏è Architecture Breakdown
Block 1: ROM Memory (Training Data Storage)
Stores 150 pre-loaded Iris flower samples
Each entry contains 4 features (16-bit each) + 2-bit class label
Automatically cycles through all 150 samples every classification
ROM Address Counter increments on each clock cycle
Block 2: Feature Extraction
Extracts the 4 features from ROM data
Extracts the 4 features from test input
Separates class label for later use
All extraction happens in parallel (combinational logic)
Block 3: Euclidean Distance Pipeline (5 Stages)
Stage 1 - Difference Calculation:

Computes difference between test features and ROM features
Four parallel subtractions (one per feature)
Uses signed arithmetic for proper distance calculation
Stage 2 - Squaring:

Squares all four differences
Eliminates negative values
Four parallel multipliers
Stage 3 - Summation:

Adds all four squared differences
Produces final Euclidean distance (squared)
No square root needed (ordering preserved)
Stage 4 - Output Buffering:

Stores computed distance
Stores corresponding class label
Generates valid signal for next block
Stage 5 - (Implicit) Handoff to Sorter

Block 4: Top-5 Sorter (Insertion Sort)
Maintains 5 smallest distances found so far
Uses bubble-sort style comparison and insertion
Updates continuously as new distances arrive
Keeps both distance values AND class labels
After 150 comparisons, holds the 5 nearest neighbors
Block 5: Majority Voting Logic
Counts how many times each class appears in top-5
Determines which class has the most votes
Outputs the winning class as final prediction
Handles ties by selecting first occurring maximum

Process next sample
Time per distance calculation: 4 clock cycles √ó 5.56 ns = 22.24 ns
Total time for 150 samples: 150 √ó 22.24 ns = 3,336 ns = 3.34 Œºs
Throughput: 45 million classifications/second
With 5-Stage Pipeline (This Design):
All 5 stages work simultaneously on different data
Once filled, produces 1 result per clock cycle
Pipeline fill time: 5 cycles √ó 5.56 ns = 27.8 ns (one-time cost)
Processing 150 samples: 150 cycles √ó 5.56 ns = 833.3 ns
Voting: 2 cycles √ó 5.56 ns = 11.1 ns
Total latency: 157 cycles √ó 5.56 ns = 872.2 ns
Throughput: 180 million classifications/second
Throughput improvement: 4x faster than sequential!
Latency vs Throughput Trade-off
Latency (Single Classification): 872.2 ns per sample
Throughput (Continuous Mode): 180 MCPS (1 result every 5.56 ns)
Key Insight: Pipeline adds 27.8 ns startup cost but quadruples throughput
Break-even Point: 2+ classifications make pipelining worthwhile
Real-World Performance Example
Classifying 1000 flowers:

Sequential Design: 1000 √ó 3.34 Œºs = 3,340 Œºs = 3.34 ms
Pipelined Design: 872.2 ns + (999 √ó 5.56 ns) = 6,427 ns = 6.43 Œºs
Speedup: 519x faster for batch processing!
Per-sample amortized time: 6.43 Œºs √∑ 1000 = 6.43 ns per classification
üéì Key Learning Points
